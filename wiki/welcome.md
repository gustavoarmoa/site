# Welcome

Welcome to the **ForCode** wiki, the central place where we collect and catalog the best content for Blockchain development and Crypto technologies.

To the left you can find the main navigation which links various pages with useful resources for different topics. There's also the magnifying glass you can click on to search for specific content.

Also make sure to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ForCode) and join our [Discord server](https://ForCode.io/discord) to get frequent updates about the Blockchain and Crypto technology space.

## Let's Collaborate

This is an open, community-driven wiki and living document which is updated frequently.

Do you see a typo, found something useful online or want to add your dev-tooling to our resources list? Please do so by opening up a Pull Request in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ForCode/site).

**Note**: Please keep in mind that the main goal of this Wiki is discoverability and ease of use, which means that we're looking for content which is helpful for as many developers as possible. Don't be discouraged if we can't accept your contribution for the time-being! In fact we're currently looking into other ways to help you showcase your projects in a more structured and feedback-oriented way.

## ForCode Community

The wiki is just one part of our [ForCode](https://ForCode.io) community. If you haven't already you might also want to join our [Discord server](https://ForCode.io/discord).
